## Game Development

### Programming Frameworks & Languages

#### Pulp + Pulpscript
A "no-code alternative to the full SDK", Pulp provides a "click-and-place" game editor right in your browser.

- [Pulp](https://play.date/pulp/)
- [The Official Pulp Forum](https://devforum.play.date/c/pulp/46)

##### Articles on Pulp + Pulpscript

- [Panic unveils Pulp - Gamasutra](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/382905/Panic_unveils_Pulp_a_free_nocode_tool_for_creating_Playdate_games.php)
- [Playdate Pulp - playdate.wiki](https://playdate.wiki/development/playdate-plup)
- [Playdate Pulp - Gamedeveloper.com](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/playdate-pulp-zero-to-video-game-in-60-seconds)

#### Lua

- [Learn X in Y minutes, Where X=Lua](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/) - A succinct Lua cheatsheet for developers with experience in other languages like Python.

##### Playdate SDK
Panic publishes two versions of their SDK: a high-level API for Lua, similar to L√ñVE, and a lower-level C library for applications with higher performance needs.

###### Official
- [Playdate SDK Lua Documentation](https://sdk.play.date/inside-playdate)
- [Playdate SDK C Documentation](https://sdk.play.date/inside-playdate-with-c)
- [Develop for Playdate](https://play.date/dev/)

###### Unofficial
- [Install Playdate SDK with Package Managers](https://gist.github.com/idleberg/e246f7a582ac173d156c60ec23ce2af0)
- [Playdate SDK Docker Image](https://github.com/hjhart/playdate-docker)
- [Playdate API and build tools in Rust](https://github.com/boozook/playdate)

###### Playdate SDK Previews

- [Playdate Unboxing + Project Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCJF4TfWno)
- [Early Playdate SDK release notes](https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1143268123098796033)
- [Code sample in /r/PlaydateConsole](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaydateConsole/comments/nw6is4/i_started_to_prototype_a_small_game_while_waiting/h18ilkg/)

##### Lua Libraries
The following libraries are expected to work well-enough on the Playdate:

- [AnimatedSprite](https://github.com/Whitebrim/AnimatedSprite) - A lua-based library for animating sprites. Containing finite state machine, json configuration and plugNplay behaviour.
- [deep](https://github.com/Nikaoto/deep) - An "action-queue" library; helpful for things like z-indexing (although the Playdate already has z-index support in its draw ordering).
- [GFXP](https://github.com/ivansergeev/gfxp) - A library with a collection of dithering patterns for the Playdate. An online version of the editor can be seen [here](https://ivansergeev.com/gfxp/).
- [Knife](https://github.com/airstruck/knife) - A collection of useful micro-modules for Lua.
- [Jumper](https://github.com/Yonaba/Jumper) - A pure Lua pathfinding library for grid-based games.
- [lua-star](https://github.com/wesleywerner/lua-star) - A* pathfinding in pure Lua.
- [middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass) - A simple OOP library for Lua that introduces inheritance, operator overloads, static variables, and mixin support.

##### LOVE
The Lua-based [L√ñVE](https://love2d.org/) framework offers a similar API to the Playdate Lua SDK, useful for prototyping before the public release of the Playdate SDK.

See [love2d-community/awesome-love2d](https://github.com/love2d-community/awesome-love2d) for additional resources.
